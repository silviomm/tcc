## ABSTRACT

This study aims to explore the concurrent computing mechanisms offered by the C#
language. First it presents concurrent data structures and threading abstractions, then
it explains how to use it while solving classical concurrent computing problems like the producer-consumer. 
The performance of the mechanisms offered by the language are evaluated in the matrix multiplication problem. 
There is also a deeper study of how asyncawait works, the asynchronous programming feature offered by the language. 
Finally, the possibility and difficulty of extending and modifying the standard language task scheduler,
which is the basis for the operation of async-await, is evaluated in order to create a priority task scheduler.
